# what the F___ is tank turn tactics?

Tank turn tactics is a strategy game for more than 1 person in which only one person can win

Rules:
- All players start at a random location on the grid, and have 3 hearts and 1 Action Point.
- Every 24 hours on a work day, everyone will receive 1 Action Point (AP). The time the point is given may vary day to day.
- The game ends when there is only one player on the grid
- At any time you like, you can do one of the four following actions:
  1. Move to an adjacent, unoccupied square (1 AP)
  2. Shoot someone who is within your range (1 AP). Shooting someone removes 1 heart from their health.
  3. Give AP to other player (how many u want AP)
  4. Upgrade your range (3 AP)
- Dead players can vote on who gets an extra AP point
